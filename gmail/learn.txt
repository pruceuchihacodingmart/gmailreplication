Componentdidmount := calls right after the page renders
componentwillunmount:= call when the page closes ,used to remove the stored memory in the state
componentdidupdate:= Is invoked immediately after updating occurs. This method is not called for the initial render.  This is also a good place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed).
